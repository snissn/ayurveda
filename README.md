They consist of:

3. Mamsa: Muscle
4. Meda: Fat
5. Asthi: Bone

questions 
- difference between rasa and rakta? 
  - Rasa inflammation vs Rakta is Immunity
   - Blood lab works is Rakta 
- Rasa and Rakta is very interlinked
- where does digestion come into this? 
  - Majja is priority and stimulator of that and it feeds into the Meda
