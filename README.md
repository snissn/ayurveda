Dhātus (dhä·tōōs), n.pl. ( from Sanskrit धातु dhātu - layer, stratum, constituent part, ingredient, element, primitive matter[1] ) in Ayurveda, the seven fundamental principles (elements) that support the basic structure (and functioning) of the body.[2]

They consist of:

1. Rasa: Plasma
2. Rakta: Blood
3. Mamsa: Muscle
4. Meda: Fat
5. Asthi: Bone
6. Majja: Nervous Tissue (marrow (bone and spinal))
7. Shukra & Arthava: Male & Female Reproductive Tissues

questions 
- difference between rasa and rakta? 
- where does digestion come into this?
